    <h1><strong><em>INSTANT BBQ</em></strong> CHICKEN</h1>
    <img src="../images/instant-bbq-chicken.jpeg">
    <p>If you’re a fan of shredded chicken, this is a must try recipe. 
        It calls for chicken thighs so every bite is ultra tender, and I have a ton of recipes to make with it like nachos, sliders, stuffed sweet potatoes, and BBQ chicken mac and cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp (32g) Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp Cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp Dry Mustard</li>
        <li>1 tsp Chili Powder (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 C (140g) BBQ Sauce of Your Choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. Coat the chicken in the oil in a large bowl before adding the bbq seasoning blend. Stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Set a pressure cooker's sauté function to high. Once hot, add the chicken and cook for 2-3 minutes before flipping and cooking an additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the bbq sauce and move the chicken around to get some sauce to the bottom of the pot. Seal and pressure cook for 5 minutes* on high with quick release pressure.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked chicken to a bowl to shred before going back in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Optional for Instant Pot Duo Crisp: Use the broil function for 8-12 minutes or broil on a baking sheet in the oven for crispy edges</li>
    </ol>
