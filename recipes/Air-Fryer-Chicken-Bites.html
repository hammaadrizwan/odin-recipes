    <p>With flavors like lemon pepper, cajun, garlic parmesan, and a 
        Chick-Fil-A grilled nuggets copycat, these air fried chicken morsels are a guaranteed crowd pleaser.
        They’re super easy to make and go great with just about anything.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast, diced</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp (16g) Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp (15g) Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Lemon Zest</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Lemon Pepper Seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Parsley Flake</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat diced chicken breast dry with a paper towel and add to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Evenly coat the chicken in the olive oil. (For seasoning blends with other liquid ingredients like soy sauce or lime juice, add in this step.)</li>
        <li>Mix your choice of seasoning blend from below in a separate bowl before adding to the chicken. Stir to evenly coat the chicken in the dry seasoning blend.</li>
        <li>Add the seasoned chicken to an air fryer basket. Air fry for 10-12 minutes at 400ºF until the chicken nuggets reach an internal temperature of 165ºF.</li>
    </ol>
